# Muvs-Digital-Clock
A configurable digital clock made by me in Python and Tkinter.

I will also post a repository on this same program but instead of the terminal and the GUI together it will be only GUI.

Run Instructions:
1. download the zip file.
2. unzip the zip file.
3. open a terminal and go to the directory where you downloaded folder.
4. run the command "python3 main.py".
5. Enjoy!
